# Election_Analysis
Seth has asked me to calculate election data to see who the winning candidate is, along with the total number of election votes casted.
My goal was to review the total number of votes cast, complete list of candidates who have received votes, percentage of votes won by each candidate, the total number of votes each candidate won, as well as the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
## Resources used: election_results.csv
Python and Visual Studio Code
## Summary
There were a total of 369,711 votes casted.
Candidates were Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane.
Charles Casper Stockham received 23%, Diana DeGette received 73.8%, and Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1%.
